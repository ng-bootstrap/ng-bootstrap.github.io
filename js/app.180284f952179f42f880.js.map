Bound to {@link CookieXSRFStrategy} class (see below)\n\t *  * `BrowserXHR` - Private factory to create `XMLHttpRequest` instances\n\t *  * {@link RequestOptions} - Bound to {@link BaseRequestOptions} class\n\t *  * {@link ResponseOptions} - Bound to {@link BaseResponseOptions} class\n\t *\n\t * There may be cases where it makes sense to extend the base request options,\n\t * such as to add a search string to be appended to all URLs.\n\t * To accomplish this, a new provider for {@link RequestOptions} should\n\t * be added in the same injector as `HTTP_PROVIDERS`.\n\t *\n\t * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/aCMEXi?p=preview))\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * import {provide} from '@angular/core';\n\t * import {bootstrap} from '@angular/platform-browser/browser';\n\t * import {HTTP_PROVIDERS, BaseRequestOptions, RequestOptions} from '@angular/http';\n\t *\n\t * class MyOptions extends BaseRequestOptions {\n\t *   search: string = 'coreTeam=true';\n\t * }\n\t *\n\t * bootstrap(App, [HTTP_PROVIDERS, {provide: RequestOptions, useClass: MyOptions}])\n\t *   .catch(err => console.error(err));\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * Likewise, to use a mock backend for unit tests, the {@link XHRBackend}\n\t * provider should be bound to {@link MockBackend}.\n\t *\n\t * ### Example ([live demo](http://plnkr.co/edit/7LWALD?p=preview))\n\t *\n\t * ```\n\t * import {provide} from '@angular/core';\n\t * import {bootstrap} from '@angular/platform-browser/browser';\n\t * import {HTTP_PROVIDERS, Http, Response, XHRBackend} from '@angular/http';\n\t * import {MockBackend} from '@angular/http/testing';\n\t *\n\t * var people = [{name: 'Jeff'}, {name: 'Tobias'}];\n\t *\n\t * var injector = Injector.resolveAndCreate([\n\t *   HTTP_PROVIDERS,\n\t *   MockBackend,\n\t *   {provide: XHRBackend, useExisting: MockBackend}\n\t * ]);\n\t * var http = injector.get(Http);\n\t * var backend = injector.get(MockBackend);\n\t *\n\t * // Listen for any new requests\n\t * backend.connections.observer({\n\t *   next: connection => {\n\t *     var response = new Response({body: people});\n\t *     setTimeout(() => {\n\t *       // Send a response to the request\n\t *       connection.mockRespond(response);\n\t *     });\n\t *   }\n\t * });\n\t *\n\t * http.get('people.json').observer({\n\t *   next: res => {\n\t *     // Response came from mock backend\n\t *     console.log('first person', res.json()[0].name);\n\t *   }\n\t * });\n\t * ```\n\t *\n\t * `XSRFStrategy` allows customizing how the application protects itself against Cross Site Request\n\t * Forgery (XSRF) attacks. By default, Angular will look for a cookie called `'XSRF-TOKEN'`, and set\n\t * an HTTP request header called `'X-XSRF-TOKEN'` with the value of the cookie on each request,\n\t * allowing the server side to validate that the request comes from its own front end.\n\t *\n\t * Applications can override the names used by configuring a different `XSRFStrategy` instance.

You should end up with the code similar to:</p>\\n  <pre>import &#123;NgbModule} from '@ng-bootstrap/ng-bootstrap';\\n\\n@NgModule(&#123;\\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\\n  imports: [NgbModule, ...],\\n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\\n})\\nexport class AppModule &#123;\\n}</pre>\\n  <h3>\\n    Getting Help\\n  </h3>\\n  <p>\\n    Please, do not open issues for the general support questions as we want to keep GitHub issues for bug reports\\n    and feature requests.
